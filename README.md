Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing proactive measures to improve customer retention.
Objectives
- Analyze customer data to understand factors contributing to churn.
- Build predictive models to classify customers as "churn" or "not churn."
- Evaluate model performance and implement the most effective solution.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which contains the following attributes:
- Customer Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents, etc.
- Services: Phone Service, Internet Service, Streaming TV, etc.
- Account Information: Contract type, Payment method, Monthly charges, Total charges.
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No).

Source
You can download the dataset from Kaggle or other public sources.
Workflow
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features for uniformity.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)- Analyze key features influencing customer churn.
- Visualize churn patterns using charts and graphs.

- Model Building- Choose algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train models and optimize hyperparameters.

- Evaluation- Assess model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

- Deployment- Deploy the model using a web application framework (e.g., Flask, Streamlit).
- Provide an interactive interface for users to input data and view predictions.


Tools and Libraries
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask/Streamlit
- Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results
- Provide a summary of the model's performance.
- Highlight insights from the analysis.

Future Work
- Include customer segmentation for personalized retention strategies.
- Incorporate external data for improved predictions.
